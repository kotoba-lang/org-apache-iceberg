(ns iceberg.metadata
  "`metadata.json` — the file a catalog points at, and the root of everything
  else.

  It names the table's schema, its partition specs, and every snapshot; each
  snapshot names one manifest list. A reader that has this file needs no
  directory listing to know what the table contains, which is the property the
  whole format exists to provide.

  ## Ids here are identity, not decoration

  `table-uuid` distinguishes this table from another that reused its location.
  `snapshot-id` is what a reader time-travels to. Both are generated once and
  then carried, so both are parameters with defaults rather than values this
  namespace invents on every call -- a metadata file rebuilt with a fresh uuid
  is a different table wearing the old one's location."
